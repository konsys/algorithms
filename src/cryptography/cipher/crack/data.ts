  'Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that examines the fundamental nature of reality. It’s not about magic or mysticism; it’s about asking "What is actually going on here?" beyond what we can measure with a ruler or a microscope.\n' +
  'While physics explains how the world works, metaphysics asks why it exists and what it is made of at the most basic level.\n' +
  'The Big Questions\n' +
  "Metaphysics focuses on problems that science can't fully solve through observation alone:\n" +
  'Ontology (Being): What does it mean for something to "exist"? Are numbers real, or just concepts?\n' +
  'Identity and Change: If you replace every plank on a wooden ship, is it still the same ship? (The Ship of Theseus).\n' +
  'Space and Time: Are they "stages" that things move through, or are they just relationships between objects?\n' +
  'Mind vs. Matter: Is your "mind" just a series of electrical impulses in the brain, or is consciousness something separate?\n' +
  'Necessity and Possibility: Could the universe have been different, or is this the only way things could have turned out?\n' +
  'Origin of the Name\n' +
  'The term comes from Aristotle. After he wrote his books on "Physics," he wrote another set of books on "First Philosophy." Centuries later, editors labeled these books Ta meta ta physika—literally meaning "the ones after the physics." Over time, the meaning shifted to represent things that are "beyond" or "transcending" the physical world.\n';
